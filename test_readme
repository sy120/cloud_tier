Five Steps to Test Fuse Read and Write for Large TXT Files
//recreate the directory files and create 500 4K blocks in the "/home/bitnmai/files" directory
./buildblock.sh

//unmount and mount the virtual disk named "/home/bitnami/demo" 
./unmount_mount.sh 

//write test syntax: ./test write offset_number(you define), the input folder is a 40K txt file name "/home/bitnami/large_input.txt" 
./test write 100000

//read test syntax: ./test read read_size read_offset
./test read 1000000 100000

//verification - and you can see there is NO difference!
diff /home/bitnami/larget_input.txt /home/bitnami/read_output.txt
